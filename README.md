# 2019_bdc_workshops
### Instructions

To start off, please download Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/) for Linux, Mac, and Windows. Youâ€™ll be using it to run the workshops.

After that open up the getting starting folder and run the `Jupyter Essentials in 5 Minutes` notebook to get started!

We highly encourage you to read the example analysis and go through a workshop every week. Although each one will take around 30 mintues to read, you'll go over the major topics in data science and learn how to excel in this competition.

Oh and one last thing, please please ask us for help on the Slack! We want you to progress as swiftly as possible so don't be shy!
